    <div class="container">
        <p>In our growing society, we are at the age of advancement. Modern technology is always moving forward, and with it,
            we are also progressing at a rapid rate. Most of the people of our generation are heavily depended on our modern
            technology. Due to this, people create more experiments or prototypes in order to fulfill a sole purpose, to
            be able to make human society a better place. Naturally, what people invent are what people need. The best technologies
            were created to bring people a feeling of ease.</p> <br>
        <p>Articrowd is an application that deals with providing services that will bring developers to you. The word Artisan
            was derived from the words Artisan and Crowd. As we all know, crowd is a group of individuals regardless of their
            gender, work, age, or any other attribute. As for Artisan, it is a command-line interface that is included with
            Laravel, and it provides a number of helpful commands that assists an individual in building an application.
            And just like Artisan, Articrowd strives to reach its assistance to crowds and their needs on creating applications.</p><br>
        <p>Articrowd was developed by the company Meraki. Meraki is a greek word that means “doing something with soul, creativity
            and love”. This describes how passionate we are on providing people with what they need. It is as if we are to
            put something of ourselves into what we do, and what we do is to reach out to people to give assistance for them
            to have an easier lifestyle. The benefit of the people is what we strive to achieve with each new creation.</p>
